## Jupyter Notebooks and corresponding responsible person

Please note the convention regarding naming: keep the name. Each notebook has its "solution". For instance, 01_detection_qam_over_awgn.ipynb has the associated solutions_01_detection_qam_over_awgn.ipynb

01_detection_qam_over_awgn.ipynb – Classification with AWGN and artificial channels using several classifiers of scikit-learn, do not use Keras. We have the theoretical best result - Concept: increase number of sampling examples. The solution shows the sample complexity for several classifiers. Lesson: nothing better than more data - Douglas
